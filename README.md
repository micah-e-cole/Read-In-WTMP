# Read-in-WTMP
A Simple file dialogue GUI to translate wtmp files made with Python, tkinter, and C.

This project exists as I encountered the issue while completing a DFIR project on HackTheBox while using Kali Linux. As utmpdump was required to be used to complete the process and utmpdump is no longer shipped with util-linux for Kali Linux.
